### Healthnomic 
Healthnomic is derived from the word health and economy.  The physical access to hospitals is still the major barrier to both preventive and curative health services, and also the major differences between the Rural and the Urban India. By making use of web technology and AI people in remote areas can also get access to the health-care.

### Overview

This is a simple Flask web app which predicts various common illnessess. 

### Motivation

With the amount of new diseases coming up every day, there is a need for an effective method to diagnose diseases.  This was one of the disease prediction used for my B.tech major project. 

### Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org) . If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:


pip install -r requirements.txt



### Deployement on Heroku

Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.
Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)  to deploy a web app.
